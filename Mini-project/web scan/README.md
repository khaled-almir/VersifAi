## 🧠 Phishing Detection Using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
📋 Project Overview

This project presents a machine learning approach for phishing website detection using two algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression (as a linear baseline model)
  - Random Forest Classifier (as a nonlinear ensemble model)

The notebook is built and executed in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), which provides an interactive and organized environment for running, testing, and visualizing each step of the analysis.

The dataset, Phishing_Legitimate_full.csv, includes several website-based numerical features (such as domain mismatches, hyperlink patterns, and form security indicators).
The main goal is to classify websites as phishing or legitimate based on these attributes.
